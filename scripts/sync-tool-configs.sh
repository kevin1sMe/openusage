Design a new feature "$ARGUMENTS" for the OpenUsage TUI dashboard.

Read and follow the full skill specification in docs/skills/design-feature/SKILL.md.

Follow all phases in order:

1. **Phase 0 — Quiz**: Ask me all 8 questions from the skill doc before doing any design work. If I provided the feature name as "$ARGUMENTS", use that as the starting point but still confirm details. Research the codebase yourself if I don't know an answer.

2. **Phase 1 — Explore**: Read the subsystem map in docs/skills/design-feature/references/subsystem-map.md, then read the primary files for every affected subsystem. Read any overlapping design docs in docs/. Summarize what you learned that affects the design.

3. **Phase 2 — Design**: Write the design doc to docs/<FEATURE_NAME>_DESIGN.md following the template in docs/skills/design-feature/references/design-template.md. Keep it simple — no unnecessary abstractions.

4. **Phase 3 — Tasks**: Break the design into concrete, ordered implementation tasks with specific files and tests. Append to the design doc.

Complete the full checklist at the end of the skill doc before finishing.

Develop the feature "$ARGUMENTS" end-to-end — from design to pull request.

Read and follow the full skill specification in docs/skills/develop-feature/SKILL.md.

This skill orchestrates the full development lifecycle:

1. **Phase 0 — Intake**: Check for existing design doc. Ask: full lifecycle or specific phase?

2. **Phase 1 — Design** (`/design-feature`): Design the feature, produce design doc with tasks.

3. **Phase 2 — Review** (`/review-design`): Validate design against codebase, fix discrepancies.

4. **Phase 3 — Implement** (`/implement-feature`): Execute tasks with tests, parallel where possible.

5. **Phase 4 — Validate** (`/validate-feature`): Build, test, design compliance, code quality checks.

6. **Phase 5 — Iterate** (`/iterate-feature`): Fix issues from validation (loops until clean or user decides).

7. **Phase 6 — Finalize** (`/finalize-feature`): Create branch, commit, open PR.

8. **Phase 7 — Summary**: Report full lifecycle results.

Each phase pauses for user confirmation before proceeding to the next.
