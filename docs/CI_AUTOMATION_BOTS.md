# CI automation — bots & tools landscape

A research note backing the `ci/automation-bots` PR. We list every category of bot/tool we considered, what's already in place, what we're adding, and what we're explicitly skipping (and why).

> This file is a snapshot of decisions taken in May 2026. It's safe to delete or rewrite once the choices it justifies feel obvious.

## Decision summary

| Category | Choice | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Dependency updates | **Dependabot** (already in place) — extended to npm, with grouping | enabled |
| Dependabot auto-merge | **Custom workflow** using `dependabot/fetch-metadata` + `gh pr merge --auto --squash` | added |
| Go vulnerability scanning | **`govulncheck-action`** | added |
| Supply-chain score | **OpenSSF Scorecard** | added |
| Broken link checker | **`lycheeverse/lychee-action`** (nightly + on docs PR) | added |
| Release automation | **`release-please`** for changelog/version PRs | added |
| Stale issue/PR cleanup | **`actions/stale`** | added |
| Container/IaC scanning | Trivy | skipped — no container/IaC in repo yet |
| License compliance | FOSSA / `licensee` | skipped — single MIT, single license file |
| Coverage upload | Codecov / Coveralls | skipped — no public dashboard target |
| Renovate | alternative to Dependabot | skipped — Dependabot covers our case |
| Lighthouse CI | docs perf | skipped — premature; revisit when traffic grows |
| Vale / markdownlint | prose linting | skipped — high signal-to-noise cost; revisit |
| CLA assistant | external contribs | skipped — not currently accepting external PRs at scale |

## What we're adding

### 1. Extend Dependabot to npm + group updates

The repo has two npm trees we currently don't watch: `website/` (Vite marketing site) and `docs/site/` (Docusaurus). Bots have already shipped two security advisories that affected `docs/site/` — Dependabot needs to watch it.

We also add **grouping** so that `@docusaurus/*` patch+minor bumps come as a single PR instead of fifteen.

### 2. Dependabot auto-merge workflow

Approach: every Dependabot PR is auto-approved and gets squash auto-merge enabled. Branch protection on `main` enforces that every required check must pass before the squash actually fires. If CI fails, the PR sits open for human attention — no force-merging.

CI is the safety net. We trust that:

- `go test -race`, `golangci-lint`, and `vet` catch behavioral regressions
- `govulncheck` catches reachable CVEs introduced by the bump
- The Dependency Review action blocks PRs that introduce vulnerable transitive deps
- The Docusaurus build catches anything that breaks docs tooling

If those gates pass, the bump is safe to ship. The cost of human review on every patch update is higher than the residual risk this leaves.

**This requires branch protection on `main` with required status checks.** Without it, `gh pr merge --auto` merges as soon as nothing is blocking — which is "immediately" if nothing's required.

**Required-check workflows must NOT have `paths:` filters.** If a required workflow's path filter doesn't match a PR's diff, the check never fires, so the required-check gate is never satisfied, and auto-merge stalls forever waiting for a check that won't run. We've removed path filters from `lychee.yaml` and `govulncheck.yaml` for this reason. Non-required workflows (e.g. `docs-preview.yaml`) keep their path filters.

### Required checks

The current required-check set on `main`:

- `Build (ubuntu-latest)`, `Build (macos-latest)`
- `Test (ubuntu-latest)`, `Test (macos-latest)`
- `Lint`, `Vet`, `gofmt`, `Check go.mod tidiness`
- `Review` (Dependency Review), `CodeQL`, `Scan for known Go vulnerabilities`
- `Lychee`

We use the **native GitHub auto-merge** (via `gh pr merge --auto`) instead of a third-party action. Cleaner, no extra permissions to grant.

### 3. `govulncheck-action`

Go's official vulnerability scanner. Different from Dependency Review (which scans manifests) — `govulncheck` does call-graph analysis, so it only flags vulnerabilities that are actually reachable from code. Lower noise.

Runs on every PR plus nightly to catch newly-published advisories.

### 4. OpenSSF Scorecard

Publishes a public security/maintainability score (0-10) for the repo. Useful to:

- Catch missing best practices we don't even know about
- Provide a signal to downstream consumers evaluating the project
- Track score over time

Runs nightly on the default branch. Adds a badge URL to the README (separate PR).

### 5. Lychee broken-link checker

Docusaurus catches *internal* broken links at build time. It does NOT catch:

- Links to external GitHub URLs (could rot)
- Links to vendor docs (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)
- Cross-page links to legacy marketing-site URLs

Lychee fixes that. Runs:

- On PRs that touch `docs/site/docs/**` or `README.md`
- Nightly on `main` (creates a sticky issue if anything broke)

Configured to skip transient endpoints (rate-limit-prone APIs) via a `lychee.toml`.

### 6. `release-please` for automated releases

Replaces the manual tag-and-release flow. How it works:

- Watches the default branch
- Parses commit messages (Conventional Commits — we already use this)
- Maintains a draft "Release v0.X.Y" PR that always reflects what would happen if you released now
- When the PR is merged, it tags the commit and triggers the existing Goreleaser workflow (no goreleaser changes needed)
- Generates `CHANGELOG.md` automatically

Benefit: the v0.10.1 / v0.10.2 cuts we just did become a single click on a PR.

### 7. Dependabot rebase-on-main-update workflow

A separate workflow at `.github/workflows/dependabot-rebase-on-main.yaml` runs on every push to `main` and comments `@dependabot rebase` on every open Dependabot PR. Without this, after one Dependabot PR auto-merges, the others stay `BEHIND` indefinitely (GitHub doesn't auto-rebase even when auto-merge is enabled, and the `strict: true` branch-protection setting blocks merging behind branches). Standard pattern; fixes the cascade.

### 8. Stale issue/PR bot

`actions/stale` with conservative defaults:

- Issues: warn at 90 days idle, close at 120
- PRs: warn at 60, close at 90
- Anything labeled `pinned` or `security` is exempt
- Friendly comment, easy reopen

## What we're skipping (and why)

- **Trivy / container scanning** — we don't ship containers. Add when we do.
- **License compliance bots** (FOSSA, etc.) — single-license MIT project, low value.
- **Codecov / Coveralls** — coverage is already collected by `make test`; no dashboard target. Adds friction without proportional value at this stage.
- **Renovate** — superset of Dependabot's features but Dependabot covers our case and is GitHub-native. Don't run two dependency bots.
- **Lighthouse CI** for the docs site — premature. Revisit when docs traffic justifies investment in perf regressions.
- **Vale / markdownlint** — prose linting is high-signal but high-friction. Revisit when there's more contributor traffic to standardize.
- **CLA assistant** — not accepting external contributions in volume yet.

## Required repo settings

For auto-merge to work, the repo needs:

- **Auto-merge enabled** on the repo (Settings → General → Pull Requests → Allow auto-merge)
- **Branch protection** on `main` requiring CI checks to pass
- **GITHUB_TOKEN** with write permission for the auto-merge workflow

For `release-please`:

- The workflow needs `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write` on the GITHUB_TOKEN — already granted for the existing release workflow.
- **`RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` secret** — a fine-grained PAT (or GitHub App token) that lets release-please push commits in a way that *does* trigger downstream workflows (CI, Lychee, govulncheck, CodeQL). Without it, release-please uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` and its pushes are bot-attributed; GitHub Actions explicitly will not chain workflow runs from bot pushes, so the release PR sits with required checks never reporting and stays unmergeable except via admin-merge.

  To create the PAT:

  1. Go to <https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens/new> (fine-grained PAT).
  2. **Resource owner**: yourself. **Repository access**: only `janekbaraniewski/openusage`.
  3. **Repository permissions**:
     - **Contents** → Read and write
     - **Pull requests** → Read and write
     - **Workflows** → Read and write
  4. Set an expiry (90d is fine; longer if you trust your machine).
  5. Save the token. Add as secret `RELEASE_PLEASE_TOKEN` in repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions.

  The workflow falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN` when the PAT secret isn't set — so the project keeps working before the secret is configured, just with the admin-merge step.

For Scorecard:

- Public repo only (which we are)
- A `SCORECARD_READ_TOKEN` PAT with read access to GitHub branch protection settings (or skip the branch-protection check)

## Rollout order

1. Land Dependabot extension + auto-merge first; wait one week to confirm no surprises
2. Then govulncheck + lychee + Scorecard (low-risk, nightly)
3. Then release-please (changes the muscle memory for cutting releases)
4. Stale bot last, on a quiet week
